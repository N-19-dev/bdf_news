      "summary": "Whether you’re working at a large enterprise or a small business, there has likely been some need to take data out of the various source systems, process it, and then use it for either operational or analytical purposes.\n\nAdd in a few lines of code or a low-code solution, and the term data pipeline might start getting thrown around.\n\nThis might make some data engineers angry, but if you think about it, someone extracting data from a data source into Excel, adding in VLOOKUPs, some data cleansing via formulas and IFELSE() statements is essentially building a data pipeline….\n\nOk, it’s not the exact same thing, but when you stop and think about it, it can functionally solve a similar problem(although often in a more limited and specific way)\n\nMy point is that there are a lot of different ways and reasons people build data pipelines.\n\nSo, to kick off 2026, I wanted to discuss some of the key reasons data pipelines exist and the types of pipelines you will run into.\n\nA few months back, I wrote an article about what hasn’t changed in the data world. And much of what hasn’t changed are the problems we face.\n\nOf course, there are also plenty of things that have changed in the data world since I started. For example, the technologies and practices we use.\n\nEven the words and terms we use, although mostly the same, have changed. Whether you like it or not.\n\nWhen I started, no one used the term analytics engineer, and even the concept of a data engineer was still relatively new(at least in terms of how popular it later became).\n\nIn the same way, I have seen plenty of things change. Some of these changes are temporary, I believe (like my first point), others are likely larger trends.\n\nSo let’s dive into what’s changed in the data world in the last decade.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, check out some of my other top videos.\n\nIntro To Databricks - What Is Databricks\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNdiGZFaUFs\n\nThe Inconvenient Truths of Self-Service Analytics - Tell Me Lies Tell Me Sweet Little Lies\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIclW1EqeUg\n\nIf you're looking for help ingesting your data in batch or real time, then you need to check out Estuary - https://bit.ly/4eQC3oQ\n\nIf you'd like to read up on my updates about the data field, then you can sign up for our newsletter here.\n\nhttps://seattledataguy.substack.com/​​\n\nOr check out my blog\nhttps://www.theseattledataguy.com/\n\nAnd if you want to support the channel, then you can become a paid member of my newsletter\nhttps://seattledataguy.substack.com/subscribe\n\n\nTags: Data engineering projects, Data engineer project ideas, data project sources, data analytics project sources, data project portfolio\n\n_____________________________________________________________\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmLGJ3VYBcfRaWbP6JLJcpA?sub_confirmation=1\n_____________________________________________________________\nAbout me:\nI  have spent my career focused on all forms of data.
