      "title": "Levan's Unfair Top 5 Opponent Condition",
      "summary": "It was confirmed again today during the Tsonev/Kalina podcast that the reason MMT vs Kamil 2 was booked was to meet Levan's condition that his opponent be in the top 5 - MMT is currently #7. But was Morozov really top 5 when he was scheduled to face Levan at EvW8? Granted, the rankings were fuzzy at that time, but the top 10 SHW then might've reasonably looked something like: Levan Jerry Ermes Genadi Devon Prudnik Morozov Revaz Dave Michael Morozov only had right arm wins on Revaz and Dave at the time, which are arguably still his best wins to date. If Morozov was #7 then and Levan was going to pull him anyway, why is it such a big deal for MMT to be #7 today? Is Levan worried because he had to press Devon's king's move so hard his tricep was out of commission for weeks? And he doesn't want to potentially gas on Mike's like that? Levan also might not want to allow Mike time to have a long prep to become Gigamonster Michael Todd. Levan's bicep might have healed by now so he may actually end up with the prep time advantage for a June 6 supermatch if Mike beats Kamil again and they go through with it. Levan pulls infrequently enough as it is. Mike has long been chasing the match and has a strong SHW resume over decades to support a shot. I really don't think Levan's new condition is fair. submitted by /u/PowerMaster9000 [link] [comments]",

      "summary": "Hi, am amateur but am keep grinding in armwrestling. I managed to take 4th place of 21 people after year and a half of training (without training Side pressure lol but now am grinding hard sp) And i love aw. Am pretty tall, but my frame is average for my height. Am staying with 95kg category usually weighing like 96kg but on comp am getting slightly down to 94 to fit. I am 201cm tall, 95kg and i feel good in toproll, especially in one when i mainly hammer but also trying to drag. So my hand is like 22,2cm long, forearm 52,5/53cm. I think in 95cat is advantage and i Just like this category. Okay and do u have some tips? Sometimes its hard because usually i have to choose at the start to drop rise or move elbow back... Usually i prefer to move elbow back, but not too much because in my style am more of hammer than elbow drag and trying to keep rise as high as its possible but usually also drop a Little... I hate armwrestle against hookers, what would be best position of elbow and hand to armwrestle against usually shorter forearm opponents and smaller hands? Should I go really fast to defensive i mean in right hand - to force for lowhand and go back to right Side of the pad and then trying to pull to the left? Should i position myself as standard counter in this case? Usually good hook Puller can catch me and am fc*ed especially of my long arm, so in fast way my lever is bad and its over.
