      "title": "Why are Indian armwrestlers struggling internationally?",
      "summary": "​ Hey everyone, Genuine question — I’m trying to understand the bigger picture here. Why do Indian armwrestlers seem to struggle so much on the international stage? It feels like even India’s top pullers can be beaten fairly comfortably by average or mid-tier international competitors. Is it: Gaps in coaching or technical development? Strength and conditioning standards? Something cultural in training methodology? India has a massive population and a strong gym culture, so in theory the talent pool should be huge. Yet we don’t see consistent international podium finishes compared to countries like Kazakhstan, Georgia, USA, or Russia. I’m not trying to disrespect anyone — just trying to understand what’s holding Indian armwrestling back and what would realistically need to change for India to become competitive globally. Would love to hear insights from pullers who’ve trained internationally or competed against Indian athletes. Let’s keep it constructive. submitted by /u/Wonderful_Response_1 [link] [comments]",

The first clip doing pronation is 22.5kg, the hold is of 30kg, then 25kg reps and 27.5kg hold sort of. after which i go to cupping (i have experience there since im a hook puller). That is 40kg for 6 reps with a fat handle as you can see. Then there is riser 12.5kg for around 9 reps. Then Fat grip half rom pullups for back pressure. i train like this (call it my toproll day): 4 sets of pronation. (2 dynamic 2 isometric) 4 sets of cupping. (4 dynamic and holds in that as well). 3 sets of riser. (dynamic) 3 sets of half rom pullups. What i wanna know is : 1. Is this decent for my weight? 2. Are the exercises done correctly? I have low experience in toproll exercieses 3. Are the sets and reps enough? For context i started training for toproll around 1.5-2 months ago. I will upload what i do on my hook day soon as well. submitted by /u/Affectionate_Ride746 [link] [comments]",
