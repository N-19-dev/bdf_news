      "summary": "I injured my wrist about 3 years ago from arm wrestling, where my wrist was twisted into a pronated position, I don't remember clearly if I felt anything broke, but there was a lot of pain on the Ulnar side of my wrist joint. It was really painful upon wrist movement for the next 2 months, but I still maintained full function of my wrist. I continued lifting heavy a few months after the injury. Back to present time, I still lift heavy weights frequently, but it still hurts doing certain movements, examples are when doing wrist curls (wrist flexion), or when holding isometrically in wrist flexion, there is a sharp pain on the ulnar side of my wrist joint. To minimize the pain I try to lead the wrist flexion/curls with pinkies first, but If keep my hands neutral during flexion, there is a sharp pain on the ulnar side. Any idea what injury could this be? submitted by /u/Regular-Cut-781 [link] [comments]",

      "summary": "Hi, Just wanted to share with you that I've finally released my armwrestling workout tracker app on both iOS and Android. The app is specifically designed for armwrestlers, but it can be used for any weight sport, really, as it allows you to enter custom inputs as training. Pretty flexible. However, my main aim is, of course Armwrestling! I noticed many of us use notepads and boards. I saw a guy writing on the walls of his garage. The problem with that is, it's got an end. You're gonna run out of paper, of board space, or walls in your garage. That's when the idea came up. Why not have it all in one place for years? I've worked on it for around 5 months and still have a few more feature ideas to add, but for now, I think it is ready. You are the first to hear about it on social media! So far, everyone who knows about it is me, my wife, my 1-year-old daughter, and my dog. I will walk you through the app a bit, so sorry to take up your time. It has an app tour in the app itself in case you find this one boring. Here is a quick tour, hope you will enjoy! https://reddit.com/link/1r3p1ej/video/sfuur0zqg9jg1/player Home screen Active goals Active cycle Recent template Completed goals Top exercise that you can share (builds up over time after you've logged a few trainings) Latest 5 workouts Summary of all data Training screen Library (bits and bobs for beginners and maybe more experienced dudes as well) Cycles Templates (can share them with friends and group members) Scheduled trainings Logs (when adding them in there, they automatically add up on the date) Calendar screen Goals, PRs, Logs.

Oh, and it works when Offline , too, in case you train in a cave on the tip of a mountain. It is in both English and Russian. I know there are many russian speaking athletes out there that don't speak English. So, I gotcha! Also, got light and dark themes. Choose whatever suits you more. Oh, yeah, the funny icons in the library. For now, that. I am working on proper armwrestling images.

That wasn't real Devon, as my friend in the video. He is not my friend....Not yet. submitted by /u/Inside-Conclusion435 [link] [comments]",
