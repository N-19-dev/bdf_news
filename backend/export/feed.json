The advantage over these two options would be that you could check the intensity with each squeeze, and try to increase it. I realize it wouldn't be amazing for hypertrophy in itself, but is the kind of thing that could be done while driving or taking a walk. This question is related to my previous one- i.e. the fact that traditionally heavy grippers have are virtually isometric, as the significant force is only at the end of the squeeze.

It feels like there is a ton of new attention on the sport and that we're in a crossover period again where historical greats are still great while great newcomers are ready to die to be the best. All I hope for is accurate and fair reffing at the events I watch this year. That's (imo) the toughest part of arm wrestling. To grow the sport we need elbow fouls to be better defined and called consistently and evenly. We need setup to be less time consuming. We'll see what the year holds. I've been to 1 event so far this year in person and have 2 more planned already. Here's hoping the sport continues to grow for pure fans.

When quitting isn’t an option and nobody wants to look weak, the diving board comes back into play — and suddenly it looks more like a summer pool party than an ice-cold survival test.\n\nThis isn’t armwrestling — but it is everything armwrestlers are known for: toughness, competitiveness, and refusing to back down when things get uncomfortable.\n\n👇 Drop a comment and tell us who you thought would last the longest before watching.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCarJKBV9GEpXRHrw4bEEhHA/join\n👕https://www.ninelineapparel.com/discount/MONSTER20 for a discount.
