Who aged over 10 years in like 2 years and is absolutely shredded despite being huge. This ain't how it works son. I'm tired of this bs. If I could I'd bet my house on Cody not being a natural. The truth is obvious. Tests are nothing unless you test every week 2 months out. And even then competitors can pop oral roids and stimulants right before the match. Or hop back on before a match. The fatigue is real. submitted by /u/RDTxDOOM4 [link] [comments]",

      "summary": "Hi everyone, ​I’ve been working on a custom gripper design that focuses on hand anatomy. Standard eggs never felt quite right in my palm, so I developed this 87 mm height version to provide a more natural grip and even pressure distribution. ​I’ve 3D printed a multi-part mold and have been casting them using various silicone shore hardness levels. Even without a pro vacuum chamber (I used a DIY syringe setup!), the results are solid and great for daily training. ​I’m sharing the STL files for the mold so you can cast your own \"custom-tension\" grippers at home. Perfect for those who want a specific resistance that off-the-shelf products don't offer. ​You can get the STL and see my print settings here: [LINK: https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/various/mold-for-silicone-hand-gripper ] ​Let me know what you think about the 87 mm form factor! submitted by /u/Repulsive-Section-43 [link] [comments]",
