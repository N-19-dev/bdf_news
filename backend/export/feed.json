The great benefit is it means the finger joints are not getting unnecessarily stressed. Doing it this way, I could do 50% more weight and push the same muscles harder, and didn't feel like I was contributing to future arthritis in my fingers. It wouldn't work for plate curls (i.e. bicep curls holding a plate), as it would obviously fall out of your hand. submitted by /u/Ribbit40 [link] [comments]",

Here is how the workout goes : 1) Ez bar curls (52.5kg 4 sets). 2) Dumbell static holds (27.5kg 2 sets). 3) Wrist curls using fat handle. This vid clip is from the last workout video as my loading pin broke so i could not do the 40kg again today. That is 40kg x 6 reps. But today i did 25kg x 25-30 reps of dumbbell wrist curl with a towel wrapped around it. (4 sets). 4) Isolated pronation (15kg 3 sets). 5) Supination (10kg and 12.5kg total 4 sets). 6) Side pressure holds using a resistance band of 50kg (3 sets). My max side pressure on cable i think is around 32kg. What do you think of all these numbers? Am i hitting all the angles for hook? I consider myself novice for my weight class. How is the form? You can also check my previous post of my toproll workout to see my other areas of strength. submitted by /u/Affectionate_Ride746 [link] [comments]",
