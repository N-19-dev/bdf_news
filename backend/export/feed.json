      "summary": "Everytime we see him posting anything about armwrestling, It almost always is fullbody focused training. After that we see him do high velocity 100 reps on some mystic armwrestling angle then fullrom curls. Unless he has a quantum volume calculation (which he might have) on his training I really doubt that he is training optimal for armwrestling but I know for a fact that he has a very high base strenght, already strong wrist flexors and fingers and very strong sparring partners for real armwrestling strenght. Just the way his usual strenght training is kinda worrying me. I think he would find great success with georgian training methods. submitted by /u/Sensitive_Bedroom789 [link] [comments]",

      "summary": "Clubs dont exist for me, so I just armwrestle with friends/random people who want to have a go, so im not using straps. The issue I have - I have no side pressure. I work as a laborer, and climb/do some calisthenics. I can beat people bigger than me quite regularly, but if someone is faster than me to go sideways, or they can go sideways with their wrist peeled back, I get slammed. E.g, bigger gym guys, i can crack their wrist usually, but it doesnt disable enough of their side pressure because im still holding on, so i get taken straight to the table. Often if someone beats me and i ask them to try to toproll me/pull backwards instead, they cant beat me. Is the solution here to perform some form of side pressure training? Or to look at technique. For reference, i cant bench bodyweight, but i can pull up with +50% bw atm lmao. Incredibly weak shoulder/chest etc. If i try go straight sideways with people who are similar build to me who dont train, they always win. submitted by /u/Complex-Beginning-68 [link] [comments]",
