      "title": "Vitaly will need to press Devon to win",
      "summary": "I wouldn’t be surprised if Devon can hold center against Vitaly on right, but I don’t think it’s possible for his left. For the left hand match, Vitaly hits and wins center, opens Devon’s elbow angle a decent bit, but Devon keeps his pronation and Vitaly loses his wrist. Vitaly might get one or two flashpins first, but Devon works him in the setup and maybe false-starts a bit. Eventually Devon stops him in a king’s move. At that point it’s down to how much Vitaly has been training his press and how sticky Devon’s two-hand work has made his elbow and how much endurance he’s been able to buildup in his left. I used to think the left-hand match was 90/10 for Vitaly, but now I think it’s closer to 65/35 submitted by /u/NDr1 [link] [comments]",
