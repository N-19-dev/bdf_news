I tried to make a pulley system over my door frame last night to get a feel for real table pressure. I nearly ripped the trim right off the wall when I did this. I find it really annoying that good arm wrestling equipment is so hard to find. I spent a lot of time today looking on Amazon and Alibaba for the kind of equipment that professional arm wrestlers use, like steel tables and special cables. Sadly, I did not find what I was looking for. I’m currently at a crossroads. I either keep risking my security deposit with these DIY hacks, or I finally invest in something that won't snap and send a loading pin through my floorboards. Has anyone found a specific handle or strap setup that actually mimics the feel of a human hand without being a total gimmick? I’m tired of my gear being the weakest link in my training. submitted by /u/One_Repeat_1363 [link] [comments]",
