      "summary": "I have been really focused on improving my cupping and pronation. I think I have gotten as far as I can with a backpack full of rocks and a martial arts belt. I tried to make a pulley system over my door frame last night to get a feel for real table pressure. I nearly ripped the trim right off the wall when I did this. I find it really annoying that good arm wrestling equipment is so hard to find. I spent a lot of time today looking on Amazon and Alibaba for the kind of equipment that professional arm wrestlers use, like steel tables and special cables. Sadly, I did not find what I was looking for. I’m currently at a crossroads. I either keep risking my security deposit with these DIY hacks, or I finally invest in something that won't snap and send a loading pin through my floorboards. Has anyone found a specific handle or strap setup that actually mimics the feel of a human hand without being a total gimmick? I’m tired of my gear being the weakest link in my training. submitted by /u/One_Repeat_1363 [link] [comments]",

I'm talkin' dogshit level, eyes watering BAD . Im asking myself here if this guy jumped out of a FUCKING DUMPSTER before this tournament I just wanted to get over this SHIT. I even GOT DIZZY. Didn't focus on my setup and ended up with a slightly lost wrist position and he catched go before me Im 100% sure this dude would loose if it wasn't because of THIS SHIT. I easily stopped him with back engaged pronation and he just climbed in my already fucked up wrist and pressed like a orangutan So, Reddit, can this be considered a FOUL? Like, did he get an unfair advantage with that toxic breath? If not, I'm gonna make sure to bring the HEAT to the next open. submitted by /u/JH08804 [link] [comments]",
