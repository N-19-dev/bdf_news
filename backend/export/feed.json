      "summary": "Clubs dont exist for me, so I just armwrestle with friends/random people who want to have a go, so im not using straps. The issue I have - I have no side pressure. I work as a laborer, and climb/do some calisthenics. I can beat people bigger than me quite regularly, but if someone is faster than me to go sideways, or they can go sideways with their wrist peeled back, I get slammed. E.g, bigger gym guys, i can crack their wrist usually, but it doesnt disable enough of their side pressure because im still holding on, so i get taken straight to the table. Often if someone beats me and i ask them to try to toproll me/pull backwards instead, they cant beat me. Is the solution here to perform some form of side pressure training? Or to look at technique. For reference, i cant bench bodyweight, but i can pull up with +50% bw atm lmao. Incredibly weak shoulder/chest etc. If i try go straight sideways with people who are similar build to me who dont train, they always win. submitted by /u/Complex-Beginning-68 [link] [comments]",
