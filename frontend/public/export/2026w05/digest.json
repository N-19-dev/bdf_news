      "summary": "What started as a simple challenge turned into absolute chaos.\n\nMonster Michael Todd takes on a 42° ice pool challenge with elite armwrestlers Riëkard Bornman and Duvan Bornman — and things escalate fast.\n\nThe plan?\nDive in and walk 20 laps in a freezing cold pool.\n\nThe reality?\n pure ego took over.\n\nWith the pool sitting at 42 degrees Fahrenheit and the air barely warmer, pride, pain, and poor decision-making collide. When quitting isn’t an option and nobody wants to look weak, the diving board comes back into play — and suddenly it looks more like a summer pool party than an ice-cold survival test.\n\nThis isn’t armwrestling — but it is everything armwrestlers are known for: toughness, competitiveness, and refusing to back down when things get uncomfortable.\n\n👇 Drop a comment and tell us who you thought would last the longest before watching.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCarJKBV9GEpXRHrw4bEEhHA/join\n👕https://www.ninelineapparel.com/discount/MONSTER20 for a discount.

All I hope for is accurate and fair reffing at the events I watch this year. That's (imo) the toughest part of arm wrestling. To grow the sport we need elbow fouls to be better defined and called consistently and evenly. We need setup to be less time consuming. We'll see what the year holds. I've been to 1 event so far this year in person and have 2 more planned already. Here's hoping the sport continues to grow for pure fans.

The advantage over these two options would be that you could check the intensity with each squeeze, and try to increase it. I realize it wouldn't be amazing for hypertrophy in itself, but is the kind of thing that could be done while driving or taking a walk. This question is related to my previous one- i.e. the fact that traditionally heavy grippers have are virtually isometric, as the significant force is only at the end of the squeeze.
